    It didn't take long for us to realise that Prague was a different beast. We opted to take a tram to our apartment instead of the underground metro thinking it would result in a shorter walk. It's possible that the walk was shorter but the ride was <i>much</i> longer than had we taken the metro. It did give us an opportunity to see Prague and what a city it is! Around every corner we turned we were oo-ing and ah-ing about the beautiful buildings and squares. Our necks were stiff by the time we left the tram an started out 15 minute walk. I'm convinced the guitar case gets heavier over time.

    The <a href='https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4059852'>apartment we stayed in</a> was small but cosy. We had to collect the keys from a bar downstairs that had blacked out windows. I first thought it was a topless bar but it turned out to be a casino bar. Casino bars are abundant in Prague and all of them we saw had blacked out windows. There was a Albert grocery store around the corner from the apartment and we went to see how Prague's prices compared to Berlin. We were pleasantly surprised. When we were there you could get a little more than 2 Czech Koruna for R1.  Our money multiplied instead of being divided by 10! Fresh fruit was really cheap at the Albert and we ate Kiwi fruit all week. The first two nights Karin made a <i>wonderful</i> ham and mushroom pasta. It was great being able to afford eat good cooked food after a few weeks of having to scrounge for the 'cheapest option'. My mouth waters just thinking back to that pasta.

    The internet was great in the apartment, for a while at least. It would come and go due to unknown reasons. The geyser behaved similarly. There was a schedule by which the geyser operated but we never figured it out. Sometimes there was hot water and other times there wasn't. Prague was the first place we encountered a strange shower. There was a shower head but it wasn't mounted to the wall, designed to be held all the time. While I could rinse very thoroughly washing my hair was annoying. It didn't help that the hot water only sometimes lasted for the duration of the shower. We've seen many other places on AirBnb with these strange showers. The ones we've seen in Greece at least had a place to hold the shower head against the wall.

    We spent several days in the apartment just being lazy. I managed to get some good work done and we did some washing. The cold weather quelled any desire to go to town. The weather did turn after a couple of days and we went exploring.

      I wanted to explore Prague in a more structured or informative manner than we'd explored the other cities we'd visited. It dawned on me that there must be a digital tour guide app for smart phones. After some research I settled on <a href='https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/audio-europe'>Rick Steve's Audio Europe</a>. While it's not perfect it is very close to what I was looking for. While I'd love to have a location based tour that picks up on where you are and gives you info about the area you're in I couldn't find one. Rick Steve's app allows you to download walking tours for given cities. The tour gives you a start location and then follows a route giving you directions to find your way and telling you about things you'll see. It was great. Were it not for the walking tour we would have seen pretty statues and buildings and had no idea what they were. I highly recommend the app if you're looking for a cheap tour in Europe. A warning though: Rick has a really corny sense of humor.

      We paused the tour often when we got distracted. Our first major distraction was a wonderful camera shop. While I was geeking out about the camera I want to get (<a href='http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1029860-REG/sony_ilce6000l_b_alpha_a6000_mirrorless_digital.html'>Sony a6000</a>) Karin was more enamoured with the 2nd hand cameras downstairs. There were hundreds of old cameras. Everything from your standard fare Nikons and Canons to some really old ones. There was a <a href='http://www.leica-camera.com'>Leica</a> display that I drooled over. Right at the back was a trolley with leather covers for old cameras. We wanted to bring some home as gifts for some of our friends but without knowing which cameras they were for they were only good for decoration and they would have taken up space we didn't have. One of the covers even had a wind up camera in it that I fiddled with for a while trying to figure out the shutter mechanism. After spending a good half hour looking at old cameras we went upstairs to price the camera I wanted. It turned out that we didn't have space for that either. :(

    While we were following the tour down the main square of Prague we stumbled upon some <a href='http://www.czechtourism.com/e/prague-carnevale/'>Carnevale</a> food stores. It turns out that we just happened to be in Prague during carnival time! We'd originally wanted to head to Dusseldorf for their carnival which fell at the same time but it's location didn't fit in with our travel plans. Prague's carnival was just lucky timing. The food stores were selling hot wine and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trdeln%C3%ADk'>Trdeln√≠k</a>, sweet bread baked around a pin that was turned in the fire. The bread was delicious if a bit pricey. We watched a local performer on one of the carnival stages while we scoffed down the treat. We ran into the same performer several times over the next few days. He wasn't very good.

    We continued our walking tour past the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_House'>Municipal House</a> and came across an unconventional busker. He was making giant bubbles using sticks and ropes. A little of to the side there were two buskers of the traditional sort, one singing and one playing a guitar. Those moments of pure delight and joy were the highlight of the trip for me up until that point. We were standing in Prague playing with bubbles while happy music filled the air. It was a special experience.

    The bubble blower gave Karin an opportunity to try her hand. I watched and laughed and enjoyed every second of it. Eventually we tore ourselves away and walked towards the town square.

    Prague's town square is very picturesque. There's a cathedral (that we couldn't figure out how to enter) and the clock tower than is home to the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_astronomical_clock'>Astronomical Clock</a>. On the hour the clock gives a little show and we saw that and the crowds that gathered to watch it twice during our stay. We also encountered the street performer who seemed to be following us as well as witnessed a <a href='http://www.segway.com/'>Segway</a> racing accident. There are several companies offering Segway tours through Prague and they ride around the square to show off the devices. After the clock's show finished we headed off toward Prague's famous <a href='http://www.czech.cz/en/'>Charles Bridge</a>.

    We got a little lost and bumped into a carnival procession but eventually reached the bridge and walked across. By the time we reached the other side we were hungry and tired and cold. We walked around for a little while looking for a place to eat. We finally settled on a little restaurant that was in a cellar. All the restaurants we visited while in Prague seemed to be built in old cellars. While most were at floor level they all had low arches supporting the building above. I could easily picture the buildings standing back when horses and carriages were the most popular form of transport. Karin and I shared a pizza and tasted some local beers. I really can't remember them sadly. I think they were good. Dammit Rob, write your stupid beer library app! The apartment called us home and to bed shortly after.

    The next night we went out for dinner with Karin's cousin Steyn. All three of us being unfamiliar with the city it took some time to settle on where to eat. When it appeared we might walk around all night I said that the 3rd place we encountered we'd eat at. It didn't look great and we hesitated. I grabbed the bull by the horns and lead us back a little ways to a place I saw down a side street. We were ostensibly attempting to eat cheaply. The place we sat down at (<a href='http://www.giovanni-praha.cz'>Giovanni's</a>) turned out to be a prize winner. The category was not price. Dinner was delicious though. I had, once again, a ham and mushroom pasta which was a taste explosion, and Karin had a salmon pasta which she enjoyed. I think Steyn had a bolognaise and I tried yet another of Prague's beers.

    A couple of days after that we went exploring the castle. It's called a castle but it looks more like a big building on a hill. I suppose palace is a better fit in my mind. The views from the castle were spectacular and the architecture within was impressive. There were many tourists mulling about. I think Prague was the first real tourist city we visited. They were everywhere. We popped into the cathedral that was within the castle walls and stuck our heads into most buildings that were free to visit.

    We walked back across Charles Bridge after leaving the castle and encountered thousands of tourists and locals on and around the bridge. Just before the bridge there was a band playing on a stage with people jumping around. I'd guess the music would be called 'oompah' music. It was the sort of music you bob up and down to and the atmosphere was infectious. We found ourselves bobbing up and down along with the crowd. We watched as a conga line formed in front of the stage and eventually moved on. We stopped at another restaurant to try and eat some traditional Czech food. I had goulash and Karin had rolled pork. Both dishes were delicious if a little small. Of course beer was had. :)

    Our second last day in Prague we forced ourselves to go and busk in an attempt to justify bringing a guitar with on the trip. We didn't make much but it was a fun experience. Singing 'In The Jungle' and belting out 'awimbaweh' in a foreign country made us feel proudly South African. After busking we took a nap and then packed our bags. We headed to the airport <i>early</i> the next morning to fly with <a href='www.airserbia.com/'>Air Serbia</a> to Athens via Belgrade. The scumbags stuck a security sticker over our Prague sticker on the guitar case. Both Prague's and Athens' airports reminded us strongly of Bloemfontein's airport. The grass was brown, the sky was blue and the air was crisp. Both airports are some way out of town so there are no big buildings around. Our trip to Athens was uneventful and I'll fill you in on the city and Santorini next time. :)
