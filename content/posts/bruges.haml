    We travelled to Bruges by train. The site we use to get an idea of what travel will cost (<a href='http://www.rome2rio.com'>Rome2Rio</a>) indicated that the train fare would be cheap. It wasn't. €58 later we were there. It was a nice train at least. It was the smoothest train ride I've been on. I was surprised to see the station left behind as I hadn't event felt us start moving.

    We decided to turn a Friday into a Saturday to avoid the tourist rush and we though we'd make the most of it by getting to Bruges quite early. We got onto the metro near the apartment just after 7am. It was still dark at that time. We watched the sunrise en route and spotted some snow next to the tracks. <strike>We've yet to actually touch snow. I'm not convinced it actually exists. Everytime I'm let down and it turns out to just be ice.</strike> <i>(We've touched snow! When I first wrote this we'd only seen it in the distance but during our trip from Cologne to Berlin we built a snowman and had a snowball fight!)</i>

    When we arrived the town was still fast asleep. Most of the shops only opened at 10am. We'd made the mistake of getting there too early. This resulted in us being tired and wanting to head home around 5pm. When our hosts saw us back at home by 6h30pm they were quite surprised that we hadn't enjoyed the night life of Bruges. Lesson learnt. I've made a note that places in Berlin and Cologne also only open at 10am. No more early mornings for us. We were awake at 5h30 for stupid Bruges. I suppose it's we that were stupid.

    Upon arrival we walked towards the exit of the train station and did a <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCmp2qbrZUQ'>Cool Runnings</a> style about turn and bought some coffee. That was the coldest day we'd experienced up unto that point. After convincing ourselves that venturing out really was worth it, after all we'd spent €58 (R760. If we'd been 25 it would have been €8. Crazy right? Missed it by 4 months) on the tickets, we walked into the town. The old city part of Bruges is not really big. I reckon you can walk from one side to the other in about 30 minutes. We walked through a really quiet area heading towards one of the towers that was visible above the roofs.

    At some stage during our stroll we heard a brass band playing and altered our course to try and reach them. Sadly we walked into a dead end after accidentally entering the premises of the Groene Museum. They stopped playing before we reached them. We reasoned later that the band must have been playing as a send off for Bruges' matrics as they went out into the town to partake in their 100 days celebratory activities. 100 days is Belgium's equivalent of South Africa's 40 days. Having only 100 days left of school the students have to complete all sorts of activities. Three times we were accosted and took part in the festivities. The first time the kids asked if they could lift Karin out of the street onto the pavement. Karin wasn't walking in the street so she had to step down only to get scooped up onto the sidewalk. Luckily we figured out what was going on (Oom Pieter's daughter mentioned to us that she had to get ready for her school's 100 days when we had dinner with them) otherwise we would have been completely lost. Later on we saw a group coming and crossed the street to avoid them only to be promptly helped back across the street. The last time we were caught we had to sign a girls tummy. We're not sure that that was a legitimate activity.

  %p
    Our first stop inside the city happened to be the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_the_Holy_Blood'>Basilica of the Holy Blood</a>. We blundered our way into the upper chapel through an entrance that caught our attention. We didn't really know what the story behind the Basilica was so I'll describe the scene with that mindset. Upon walking into the chapel we were greeted by 'musica sacra' style choir music, the sort that makes you take your beanie off. Which is exactly what we both did. There were signs on the way in that indicated that silence should be kept. I think there was one person sitting in the rows of chairs. The cathedrals and Basilicas we've seen all have chairs not pews. Off to one side was what looked like 'the bench' in an important American court with stairs leading up to a platform from both left and right. Seated behind a desk of sorts was an important looking man who I assumed to be part of the clergy. In front of him was a glass case with a tube in it. While we watched several people put some coins as a donation into a box at the foot of the stairs on the right and proceeded up the stairs to the glass box. Each person that passed the box stopped and prayed in front of it. After praying they were presented with what looked like a card by the man behind the box. They then went down the stairs on the left hand side and exited the chapel.
  %p
    As you may have guessed from the title of the Basilica the glass box apparently contains a piece of cloth that was used when preparing Jesus' body for burial. The cloth is supposed to be stained with the blood of Jesus. This blew my mind a little. Of course we only found this out when we googled the place after leaving. I discovered that in 1310 the Pope Clement V also <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_the_Holy_Blood#cite_ref-9'>issued a papal bull</a> in 1310 granting <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence'>indulgences</a> to pilgrims who visited the chapel to view the relic. Karin was and still is deeply skeptical of the artefact itself being authentic. I'm not sure either way. Needless to say with our lack of understanding we didn't pray before the box. We did however discover that the Basilica had both an upper and a lower chapel. The lower chapel came across as a lot more authentic to me. There's a lot of interesting information on the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_the_Holy_Blood'>Basilica's Wikipedia page</a>, specifically about the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procession_of_the_Holy_Blood'>Procession of the Holy Blood</a>.

    After the Basilica we wondered around some more until we reached the town square. Bruges has a really imposing Belfry at the town square. We wanted to head up to the top to see the view and the bells but it cost €8 per person so we decided against that. It was plenty pretty from the ground. We did see a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder-hole'>murder hole</a> when walking below it to reach the stairs though. I thought that was interesting.

    The <a href='http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk_%28Brugge%29'>Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk</a> in Bruge is home to Michaelangelo's Madonna & Child sculpture. One of the travel guides I read stated that it would be free to see and I thought I'd really like to see it as it's one of the few pieces of art that I can recall by name. I'm not a huge art fan. I trace that back to my junior school art lessons and the fact that I can't draw or paint any better than when I was in grade 3. Sculptures are one of the forms of art I can appreciate though. Another form I understand is Really Big Paintings. I'm hoping to see some of those in Italy and France. In the end the Madonna was hidden in the treasury section which cost €6 per person to enter. Oh well. The church itself was spectacular. It's tower is the highest building in Bruges by far and we used it to orient ourselves for the rest of the day. A major portion of the church is currently being renovated but the current side entrance and the main doors themselves are free of scaffolding and very impressive. Huge buildings like this one always serve to remind me of the power the church used to wield. It's interesting to draw a comparison to modern day Hillsong mega buildings.

    The tourist map we got from Laurent specifically mentioned horse carts and how horses don't know the rules of the road so be careful of them. We ran into some waiting horses and carts on the main square and several times throughout the day. Their occupants were mostly rich looking people who would probably only be able to walk to the fridge and back. We felt sorry for one horse in particular who was hauling along a lady who filled both seats of her cart. The big horse from Brussels would probably fare better.

    Karin particularly wanted to go on a boat tour but sadly try as we might we didn't find a single working boat tour guide. Later we read that the boats only operate over weekends in winter. So much for making Friday into Saturday. It was probably to our benefit though as at 4pm the river was still iced over. We saw a brave goose paddling its way through the ice at one stage. I took a photo to think back on when we get back to South Africa and we sit in sweltering heat. Sadly we'll be arriving just in time for winter. Again. We made do with some beautiful photos of Karin. There was an old town in the background too I guess.

    We were walking back to the train when we realised we didn't have a single photo of both of us together and hastily snapped the photo above. It's not the greatest but you can see the belfry in the background. I've been pushing for us to get a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Promaster-Selfie-Stick-Camera-Smart/dp/B00IEEN8TE'>selfie stick</a>. Karin is convinced they're only for Asian tourists. I'm of the opinion that they're becoming more widely accepted and make for some awesome fun. I don't care how silly we look we'll get some great photos of us together and enjoy the process. We don't own one yet but I'm working on it.

    We're currently in Berlin. We haven't done much yet as we're here for a week and we're trying to make up for overspending on a few days recently. Tomorrow we'll be heading out to explore the city. I'll be writing a short article about Cologne and our train trip to get there soon.
