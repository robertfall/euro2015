    We set off for Cologne in a frantic rush. We're still getting the hang of moving from place to place with all our stuff. Packing up takes a bit longer than we expect every time. On the morning we left for Cologne we'd left a little too much to do in the morning. I've learnt since then that our main bag needs to be closed and ready to go the night before. We were running around like mad chickens looking for tickets and doing final packing. We left 15 minutes after we'd wanted to. We also managed to lose our metro tickets which had 5 journeys left on them each. At least we had our expensive train tickets with us.

    We'd booked tickets on a German ICE (inter city express) train which is a high speed train. I was chatting to Karin this morning about how I call them ice trains but the locals don't seem to know what I'm talking about. I realised that the German word for ice is probably not spelt I-C-E. That's how everyone has referred to them: I-C-E trains. Regardless, it was our first high speed train in Europe. Overall it's very comparable to the Gautrain with seats meant for longer journeys. Train seating plans are as to be expected. Depending on the age of the train you get a varying mix of compartments and saloon style seating which is similar to bus seating. You get the usual two by two seating as well as four seats facing each other with a table in between. We enjoy the table seats as I can work and Karin can use the table to rest her head on.

    When it comes to planes and trains I'm still a little boy inside. I enjoy the experience greatly and spend a lot of time staring out the window. Our boarding experience was rather traumatic. When booking a train ticket in Europe you have the option of paying a little extra to get a reserved seat. This way you can choose where you're sitting. If you don't reserve your seat you have to wonder around looking for an open seat to sit in. The ICE train has little electronic displays above each seat that display the name of the passenger that reserved the seat. When we boarded all the displays were showing something about a reservation in German. They all looked the same. I went outside to ask one of the attendants and she told me that I should look for a free seat and if I couldn't find any that the train was full. While I understood that you <i>can</i> reserve a seat I'd assumed that the company (<a href='http://www.bahn.de'>DB Bahn</a>) wouldn't sell more tickets than there were seats on the train. I'd left Karin in the train when I went looking for information so I went back to tell her what was going on. As soon as I hopped back on the train it started moving. Seat or no seat we were going to Cologne.

    The trains are quite long and while making my way back through the 4 carriages that I'd walked through on my quest for information the same lady I'd spoken to made an announcement over the train's PA system that the reservations system was malfunctioning and they couldn't show seat reservations accurately. I got back to a worried Karin and settled down. In the end our seats hadn't been reserved. Some other people around us got asked to move but we got to enjoy our table seats for the short journey to Cologne. And short it was. The carriage had a display that occasionally showed the speed we were going. The fastest I saw it get to was 260km/h. The little boy in me loved it. Heck, the adult in me loved it.

    After getting off the train we headed straight for our accommodation. I made the mistake of buying us a day pass for the metro system. For €16.90 up to 5 people can travel with the pass until 3am of the day following that on which you purchased the pass. This would have been very cost effective had we actually been a group of five people or had we been there for the entire day. We stepped off the traion around 12:15pm.

    We arrived at the apartment after almost heading the wrong way on the metro. Long, the host, was super friendly and while there was a slight language barrier his enthusiasm was great. Long rented out one of the two rooms in <a href='https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1350040'>the apartment</a> and used the other as his office so in the evening we had the place to ourselves. After dropping off our bags we went out into the city to make the most of our night in Cologne.

    The Cologne station is right next to it's massive cathedral, the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne_Cathedral'>Dom</a>. We decided to walk to the Cathedral as we wanted to see a bit of the town and it wasn't far from where we were staying. Before arriving in Cologne I'd thought it was a small town along the lines of Bruges. It's actually Germany's fourth largest city. One day, or one afternoon, isn't really enough to do the town justice. On our way to the cathedral we passed the perfume museum where they tell the story of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eau_de_Cologne'>Eau de Cologne</a>. We managed to smell 'the original' cologne at one of the tourist shops. It's very sweet. We also walked past what appeared to be a government building with some interesting carvings above it's entrance way. None of this however compared to the Cathedral itself.

    The main entrance to the cathedral is intricately detailed with four different layered arches each decorated with figures overlooking the doorway. The doors have been replaced with automatic sliding glass doors. It's interesting how unobtrusive glass is on old buildings. The old Methodist church in the center of Cape Town has also installed glass doors and it doesn't detract too much from the architecture. The same can be said of the doors of the Cologne Cathedral. Not as inspiring as the original doors but not distracting neither. The entryway is just the culmination of the detailing of the entire façade is amazing. Inside we saw pews! It was the first cathedral we'd visited in Europe that had pews and not chairs. The highlight of the cathedral for me was definitely the stained glass windows. While I've heard people proclaiming their love for stained glass before this was the first time that I'd really been impressed. The windows are stunning. We stood and admired one for several minutes. There are several different scenes depicted and even one window that's made up of coloured squares that looks to be a modern addition. I'm not really sure how to describe them further other than to say that they are truly worth seeing.

    We also headed down into the crypts of the cathedral but were both a little disappointed. There wasn't much down there that was publicly accessible, only a small chapel. It seemed as if the  other areas opened at other times and were more interesting. On one side there's an archeology museum and the other side looked to contain viewing windows into something. We completed our circle of the cathedral admiring the glass and exited the other side.

    After the walk to and through the cathedral we were exhausted and hungry so we went to a grocery store and got some food for the night and the next day and then back to the apartment. We intended to go out again later but couldn't keep our eyes open and passed our for an afternoon nap. We spent the evening at the apartment recovering from the stressful journey and prepared for the next day.

    The following morning we woke up to a light snow fall. Thomas, an old friend of <a href='http://ctyc.co.za'>CTYC</a> (the choir we used to sing with), offered to help us out with a lift to Berlin and arrived ahead of schedule. While we hadn't unpacked the night before we still had a little bit of a rush to get dressed and on our way. The light snow fall would later in the day turn into a heavy snow fall and lengthen the 6 hour journey to Berlin to 12 hours. But this post is already long enough so that story can wait for next time. :)
